# custom-mvc-demo
Demo of a very basic MVC architecture in PHP for BeCodians.

This project answers [this briefing](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXLCentral/tree/master/Projects/12-MVC).



## To-do

- Make the page `<title>` tag content dynamic, optimized for SEO.
- Convert the router to OOP. For instance, you could have a `Page` object and one method per page, so you could write...  

```php
Page->login();
```

... too launch the login controller + template

```php
Page->about();
```
... to show the about page, etc.

## Thanks
- Template Stellar by [HTML5 UP](html5up.net)
